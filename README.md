# UNSCRAMBLR
 
Gameplay Overview:

The objective of the game is to unscramble words as fast as possible while minimizing the number of attempts.
Players are presented with scrambled words that they must unscramble within a set time frame. The faster and more accurately they unscramble the words, the higher their score.
Key Features:
Difficulty Levels:

Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels are available. Each level offers a different set of scrambled words with varying complexity.
The difficulty level affects the points you earn and the time bonus you receive.
Timer and Scoring System:

A real-time timer tracks how long it takes for the player to solve the word.
Players accumulate points based on the difficulty level, number of attempts, time taken, and hints used.
Total Score Calculation:
Points are awarded based on difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
Time and attempt bonuses can increase the score, while using hints will deduct points.
Hints:

Players can ask for hints, but there is a point deduction for each hint used.
High Score Tracking:

High scores are stored in a file (high_scores.txt), and the game displays the top scores at the end of each session.
Scores are ranked based on the highest total points, and players can compare their scores across different games.
Word Lists:

Each difficulty level has a pre-set list of scrambled words. For example, the easy level includes simpler words like "toss" and "blue," while the hard level includes words like "Freedom" and "Whisper."
User-Friendly Interface:

Instructions and prompts guide the player throughout the game.
Players are asked to select a difficulty level and enter their name, which is then recorded along with their score.
Replayability:

After each round, players are given the option to play again, allowing for repeated attempts to improve scores and rankings.
